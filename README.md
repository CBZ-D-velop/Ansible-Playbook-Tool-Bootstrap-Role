An Ansible role to bootstrap and create other roles.

The Role Bootstrap role automates the creation of a basic structure for an Ansible role. It sets up the necessary folders, files, and configurations to jumpstart your role development process. With a focus on best practices, this role includes the following features:

Predefined Folder Structure: The role creates a well-organized folder structure, including defaults, files, handlers, meta, molecule, tasks, templates, tests, vars, and more. This ensures consistency and ease of maintenance throughout your role development.

Code Quality Tools: The role includes configuration files such as .ansible-lint, .ansible.cfg, and .yamllint to help maintain high-quality code and adhere to best practices.

Collaboration Support: The inclusion of a CODEOWNERS file enables easy collaboration and ownership assignment within your Git repository.

Molecule Integration: The role comes preconfigured with Molecule, a testing framework for Ansible roles. It includes default molecule scenarios and GitLab CI configuration for continuous integration.

By using the Role Bootstrap role, you can accelerate the creation of new Ansible roles, adhere to best practices, and focus on the core functionality of your roles.

## Folder structure

By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content (also man.yml and main):

```PYTHON
.
├── README.md  # Contains an overview of the role and its purpose.
├── defaults
│   ├── main.yml  # Contains default variables for the role that can be overridden by users.
│   └── README.md  # Contains documentation for the default variables.
├── files
│   └── README.md  # Contains documentation for the files in the directory.
├── handlers
│   ├── main.yml  # Contains handlers that can be called by tasks within the role.
│   └── README.md  # Contains documentation for the handlers.
├── meta
│   ├── main.yml  # Contains metadata about the role, including dependencies and supported platforms.
│   └── README.md  # Contains documentation for the role metadata.
├── tasks
│   ├── main.yml  # Contains tasks to be executed by the role on the managed nodes.
│   └── README.md  # Contains documentation for the tasks.
├── templates
│   └── README.md  # Contains documentation for the templates.
└── vars
    ├── main.yml  # Contains variables that are specific to the role and are not meant to be overridden.
    └── README.md  # Contains documentation for the role variables.
```

## Tests and simulations

### Basics

You have to run multiples tests. *tests with an # are mandatory*

```MARKDOWN
# lint
# syntax
# converge
# idempotence
# verify
side_effect
```

Executing theses test in this order is called a "scenario" and Molecule can handle them.

Molecule use Ansible and pre configured playbook to create containers, prepare them, converge (run the role) and verify its execution.
You can manage multiples scenario with multiples tests in order to get a 100% code coverage.

This role contains a ./tests folder. In this folder you can use the inventory or the tower folder to create a simualtion of a real inventory and a real AWX / Tower job execution.

### Command reminder

```SHELL
# Check your YAML syntax
yamllint -c ./.yamllint .

# Check your Ansible syntax and code security
ansible-lint --config=./.ansible-lint .

# Execute and test your role
molecule lint
molecule create
molecule list
molecule converge
molecule verify
molecule destroy

# Execute all previous task in one single command
molecule test
```

## Installation

To install this playbook, just copy/import this playbook or raw file into your fresh playbook repository or call it with the "include_playbook/import_playbook" module.

## Usage

### Vars

```YAML
# From inventory

```

```YAML
# From AWX / Tower
---
all vars from to put/from AWX / Tower
```

## Architectural Decisions Records

Here you can put your change to keep a trace of your work and decisions.

### 2023-04-27: First Init

* First init of this role with the bootstrap_role playbook by Lord Robin Crombez

### 2023-05-05: SSL/TLS Testing

* Addin a /certs folder in the test directory, to test the SSL/TLS if needed
* Import the bootstrap_ssl_files to create the certs is possible to

### 2023-05-30: Cryptographic update

* SSL/TLS Materials are not handled by the role
* Certs/CA have to be installed previously/after this role use

### 2023-10-06: New CICD, new Images

* New CI/CD scenario name
* Molecule now use remote Docker image by Lord Robin Crombez
* Molecule now use custom Docker image in CI/CD by env vars
* New CICD with needs and optimization
